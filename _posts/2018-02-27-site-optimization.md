When you go to host a website, often times engineers don't ever think about speed and data usage. When someone visits your site, speed and data usage matters. If you've ever visited a site on your phone that loaded slowly, you know the frustration that it can cause. You as a developer want to avoid causing that feeling in your users as much as possible. Because of that you should make an effort to optimize your site, both for search engines, and your users. 

I have found quite a few tools in which to do that with, they're called Ngnix and Grunt.

## First things First

What causes sites to load slowly? That's the first thing you should consider when thinking about optimizing your site. The obvious answer is that it is loading a lot of data. But there are likely ways to lower that amount of data without changing how your site looks or works.
