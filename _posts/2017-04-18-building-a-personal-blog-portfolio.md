title:  Building a new Personal Site
subtitle: I guess I should actually write a blog now huh?
description: I was tired of the pretty garbage looking website that I had for a long time and I decided I wanted a new one. I also wanted to see if it would be worth setting up a blog. So here we go!

I guess I have a blog now?
I never really saw myself as someone with a blog. However when I was looking into designs for remaking my personal site, I just kept coming back to the design of a blog.
The longer I thought about it, The more interesting the thought became.

So I wanted to make a nice looking personal portfolio site. The problem with a portfolio site is that I don't have a lot to show off. I have a few programming projects I'm proud of, but nothing that really sticks out. I have [Git-Challenge]() which is my newest project that I can say I'm proud of. However most of the projects I have to show were made back in high school and looking back I have 100 different ideas of ways to *fix* them. But because of the nature of them being for my high school, I'd rather let current student try and fix them as a learning opportunity. That's part of what spawned my idea for the aforementioned [Git-Challenge]().

So why a blog? Why not stick with my static [Resume site](http://www.devinmatte.me)? I mean it looks good enough and would do a good enough job of showing off my skills and abilities. However what I wanted was a bit more than that. Somewhere to not just share my projects, but to also share what I've recently learned. A lot of what I do on an average day is less building specific projects, but playing around with random tools. Since I started using Linux this year I've learned **tons**. But it's hard to show that off in a project. But I can easily articulate it into a blog post/article. Like yesterday I learned about [GPG Keys and Signing git commits](/git/2017/04/19/signing-git-commits), but that's not really a project. It's a tool, something useful and interesting, but hard to build something with. So I finally decided this is the medium I want to use to talk about what I'm learning.
