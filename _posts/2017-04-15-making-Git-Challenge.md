Git Challenge was a project I had an idea for when I looked over a GitHub Organization I was a part of. It is for my old High School Technology Team, the organization that taught me most of what I knew about programming before I arrived at RIT. The projects in the GitHub hadn't been touched by anyone except myself and a few other Team Alumni. So I thought I should come up with a way to encourage contributing to these projects, and to teach people git. So I came up with Git-Challenge.

Git Challenge is an app made to gamify contributing to projects, for any Organization. Not just this Tech Team. It could be used for CSH, or really any other git organization with multiple contributors.
