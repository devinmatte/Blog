Git Challenge was a project I had an idea for when I looked over a GitHub Organization I was a part of. It is for my old High School Technology Team, the organization that taught me most of what I knew about programming before I arrived at RIT. The projects in the GitHub hadn't been touched by anyone except myself and a few other Team Alumni. So I thought I should come up with a way to encourage contributing to these projects, and to teach people git. So I came up with Git-Challenge.

Git Challenge is an app made to gamify contributing to projects, for any Organization. Not just for the [Tech Team](), It could also be used for [Computer Science House](), or really any other git organization with multiple contributors. I wanted to build this whole project with the intention of anyone being able to deploy it for any organization. I learned about Environment variables, continuous integration, containers, SQL databases, and APIs. Basically I learned way more about building a web application than I ever thought I would from this project. I am incredibly proud of this project.
