Git Challenge was a project I had an idea for when I looked over a GitHub Organisation I was a part of. It is for my old High School Technology Team, the organisation that taught me most of what I knew about programming before I came here. The projects in the GitHub hadn't been touched by anyone except myself and a few other Team Alumni. So I thought I should come up with a way to encourage contributing to these projects, and to teach people git. So I came up with Git-Challenge. A app made to gamify contributing to projects, for any Organisation. Not just this Tech Team. It could be used for CSH, or really any other git organisation with multiple contributors.
