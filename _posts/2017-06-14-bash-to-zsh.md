When I first started getting into using Linux, the first tool I used was Bash on Ubuntu on Windows. Like many students starting out, that and git bash were my primary introductions to command line utilities. However as I transitioned to Linux I learned that there are more shells than bash. And being curious, I decided to check one different one out. Zsh.
